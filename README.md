# traffic-sign-recognition
NOTE : 
1. Data is used from https://www.kaggle.com/meowmeowmeowmeowmeow/gtsrb-german-traffic-sign
2. Both the data files and source code file should be stored in same location, if not in same location then edit the path in source code accordingly

Given the image of traffic sign the model can classify it to one of the 43 classes that it is trained for using convolutional neural networks.
